I am currently a graduate student of Physics at Indiana University, Indianapolis (previously IUPUI).

- My research interests lie broadly in the field of theoretical and computational physics, with emphasis on gravity, cosmology and quantum systems. 
- I am currently studying the interaction of patch potentials of a conductor plate with an optically trapped quantum dot in a harmonic potential, placed approximately 200nm above the plate.
- Previously I have worked on the topics of axions in particle physics and cosmology, AdS black-holes, neutrino physics, indirect detection of dark matter and basics of quantum field theory.
- I obtained my Masters in Physics from NISER (National Institute of Science, Education and Research) India in 2023. Currently pursuing a second masters in Physics (Purdue University Diploma in IU Indianpolis campus).

Please look into the repository "ashmita14" to find my project reports and codes, which have been organised into different folders.
